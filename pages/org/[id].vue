        <p>In the world of AI, behavioural predictions are leading the charge to better machine learning.</p>

        <p>
          There is so much happening in the AI space. Advances in the economic sectors have seen automated business
          practices rapidly increasing economic value. While the realm of the human sciences has used the power afforded
          by computational capabilities to solve many human based dilemmas. Even the art scene has adopted carefully
          selected ML applications to usher in the technological movement.

          As a Senior Client Engineer, you'll work alongside other engineers, designers, and product managers to tackle
          everything from huge company initiatives to modest but important bug fixes, from start to finish. You'll also
          collaborate with your product team on discovery, helping to assess the direction and feasibility of product
          changes. And, perhaps most importantly, you'll actively contribute to the evolution of the culture and
          processes of a growing engineering team.

        <p class="text-xl font-bold text-black dark:text-white">About You</p>
        <p>
          You love building great software. Your work could be supporting new feature development, migrating existing
          features, and creating other mobile and web solutions for customers. You'll have a primary focus on frontend
          development using Javascript. Our client's tech stack is JavaScript, primarily using React. A strong
          understanding of JS core (ES2019+) is required, with some exposure in Java as back-end technology. We use
          modern tools, which means you'll have the opportunity to work with Webpack, Redux, Apollo, Styled Components,
          and much more.
        </p>

        <p>
          You love learning. Engineering is an ever-evolving world. You enjoy playing with new tech and exploring areas
          that you might not have experience with yet. You are self-driven, self-learner willing to share knowledge and
          participate actively in your community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having overlap with your team is critical when working in a global remote team. Modus requires all team
          members to overlap with EST morning hours daily. In addition, reliable high speed internet is a must.

            Travel and meet great people- as part of our remote-first lifestyle, it's important that we come together as
            needed to work together, meet each other in person and have fun together. Please keep that in mind when you
            apply
